# U-Reg Coding Challenge (Full-stack)

You are required to develop a simple web application (API and frontend) that displays the latest and historical exchange rates.

On initial load, call an API endpoint to display the latest exchange rates for all available currencies. Application should also provide a way to check the historical exchange rates through a date picker. When a date is selected, get the rates for the selected date using the same API endpoint and display it in application.

You can use this for the database schema and seed data: https://gist.github.com/ureg-tech/e4168553bb7d3f0f8ef23c23917dc0b0

You can use the wireframe below for reference:

Feel free to develop this application in any language, framework, database you prefer. Please don't forget to add a simple readme file on how to install and run your application.
